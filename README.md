# Kenobi Walkthrough

## Objective

This lab was a walkthrough of a tryhackme room that I used to showcase my practical skills. It consists of enumeration with nmap and smbclient. I mimicked the techniques of an attacker by performing privilege escalation on the system with path variable manipulation. I also exploited an intentionally vulnerable version of proftpd.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of network protocols.
- Proficiency in exploting a vulnerable service.
- Further Enumeration of target machines
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Privilege Escalation using path variable manipulation.

### Tools Used

- Network Mapper (Nmap) for scanning of IP addresses.
- Netcat for exploiting the Proftpd.
- Searchsploit for discovery of exploits.
